### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with over 8 years of experience, during which I have faced challenges that have allowed me to grow professionally and personally.

I have had the opportunity to collaborate with great colleagues on some projects, and in others, take the lead and pull the weight.

I have solid skills in software development, database design, system integration, problem solving, and performance optimization. Additionally, I am accustomed to working in agile environments and am committed to delivering high-quality products.

My experience covers a wide range of technologies, and my main expertise is in PHP and JavaScript.
