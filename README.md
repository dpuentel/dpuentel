### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a software engineer with extensive experience, I am well-versed in a variety of programming principles and practices, including the principles of **SOLID**, **TDD**, and architecture patterns such as **Hexagonal Architecture**.

I am also skilled in designing and implementing **CI/CD** pipelines. This has allowed me to automate many aspects of the software development process, resulting in increased *efficiency* and *faster delivery* times.

One of my core values is the production of understandable software. I believe that software should be developed with **readability in mind**, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain. This approach has led to *better collaboration* with team members, *faster onboarding* of new team members, and *reduced technical debt*.
